# ETL-Project

Project Proposal – Currently, as world is facing a pandemic called Covid-19, the economies across the
globe are fluctuating. There is a variation in the market which is leading to uncertainty across different
sectors. These changes are leading to unemployment, lack of demand of the nations good’s and services
and decrease in productivity. In contrast to that our company figured a bunch of data which includes
USA covid-19 and NYC stock exchange files and our team is tasked to migrate it to production data base.
Sources of Data – a) data. World b) Kaggle c) Yahoo finance website

Main ProcedureETL - ETL stands for Extract, Transform and Load, which is a process used to collect data from various
sources, transform the data depending on business rules/needs and load the data into a destination
database.
The project started with lots of brainstorming within the team where we discussed different scenarios
and ways to receive the data. We went through various websites like data.world, Kaggle and yahoo
finance to finalise the data which looked productive and appealing to our eyes. The USA Covid-19 csv
and New-York stock exchange csv files used for this project are taken from the above-mentioned
sources of data. Even to make this project more challenging we scraped a stock table from yahoo
finance website.

Extraction Process -
The individual csv files were visualised by team members to discover if the columns and rows are well
structured with proper values. The team after mutual discussion finalised the columns in both the data
sets and started working ahead.
